            <p>Centennial Park is one of Nashville’s most popular parks, and includes historical monuments, an Art Center, and other activities such as a volleyball court, a dog park, and a walking trail. <br>It was home to the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition, a festival to commemorate the <br>100th anniversary of Tennessee joining the Union. This event led to the creation of the <br>Parthenon replica, which is an exact copy of the one in Athens, Greece. This monument is home to the park’s art museum.</p>
