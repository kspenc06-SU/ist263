    <body>
    My name is Kerry Spencer and I am a sophomore in the School of
    Information Studies majoring in Information Management & Technology. I am
    planning on having concentrations in both Web Design Management & Project Management,
    and I am also applying for a Newhouse major in Advertising.

    I have coding experience in multiple languages, including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, and R.
    This past summer, I was the TA for the IT Girls Program, which taught around 20 young women about the
    world of technology, exploring concepts such as Cybersecurity and Data Analytics. I am also an iSchool
    Admissions Ambassador, which means that I get to talk to both prospective and new iSchool students about
    this school and I work at different admissions events such as Orange Preview and Spring Reception.

    Outside of work, I like spending time with my friends and family. I also enjoy watching TV shows, my favorites
    being crime procedural shows like Criminal Minds or Bones.

    A fun fact about me is that my family just adopted a cat, a tuxedo cat named Lloyd!
