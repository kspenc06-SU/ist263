        <h1>Kerry Spencer's Biography</h1>

        <p>My name is Kerry Spencer and I am a sophomore in the School of
        Information Studies majoring in <strong>Information Management &amp; Technology.</strong>
        I am planning on having concentrations in both Web Design Management
        &amp; Project Management, and I am also applying for a Newhouse major in
        Advertising.</p>
        
        <p>I have coding experience in multiple languages including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Visual Basic</li>
                <li>R</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This past summer, I was the TA for the <strong>IT Girls Program</strong>, which taught around 20 young women 
        about the world of technology, exploring concepts such as Cybersecurity and Data Analytics.</p>
        
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>I am also an <strong>iSchool Admissions Ambassador</strong>, which means that I get to talk to both
        prospective and new iSchool students about this school and I work at different
        admissions events such as Orange Preview and Spring Reception.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, I like spending time with my friends and family. I also enjoy watching
        TV shows, my favorites being crime procedural shows like Criminal Minds or Bones.</p> 
        
        <p>A fun fact about me is that my family just adopted a cat, a tuxedo cat named Lloyd!</p>
